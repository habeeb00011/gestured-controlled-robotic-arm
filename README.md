 Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm (Proteus Simulation)

🚀 Overview
This project simulates a gesture-controlled robotic arm using Proteus and *Arduino Uno R3. It demonstrates how a potentiometer can control servo motor movements, which is fundamental in robotics and automation. 

 How It Works:
- A potentiometer generates varying voltage signals based on its position.
- The Arduino Uno R3 reads these signals and processes them.
- A servo motor receives the processed signals and moves accordingly.
- The movement of the potentiometer directly affects the servo motor, allowing real-time control in the simulation.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced gesture-based control systems and can be expanded to use sensors like accelerometers or gyroscopes for more complex hand-motion tracking.

 🛠 Technologies Used
- Microcontroller: Arduino Uno R3  
- Actuator: Servo motor  
- Input Device: Potentiometer  
- Software: Proteus, Arduino IDE  
- Programming Language: C++ (Arduino)  

 🔧 How It Works
1. The potentiometer adjusts the voltage level, acting as a control input.  
2. The Arduino Uno R3 processes this input and maps it to the servo motor's movement.  
3. The servo motor moves in response to the potentiometer's position.  
4. The Proteus simulation visually represents this interaction.  

 🖥 Setup & Installation
1. Install Proteus and Arduino IDE.  
2. Load the Proteus simulation file.  
3. Upload the Arduino code to the virtual microcontroller.  
4. Run the simulation to observe the servo motor responding to potentiometer movements.
